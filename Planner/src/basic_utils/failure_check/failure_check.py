    Analyze and categorize navigation failure types

    This function provides comprehensive failure analysis by examining agent behavior,
    exploration results, and spatial relationships with target objects to determine
    the specific type of navigation failure that occurred.

        episode: Navigation episode containing goals and environment info

        pass_object (bool): Whether agent passed near target object
        near_object (bool): Whether agent ended near target object

        - "no frontier": No more explorable areas
